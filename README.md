# Fun Calculator 🎉

A simple and fun calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers with a touch of humor! 😄

## Features ✨

- **Addition** ➕: Adds two numbers together.
- **Subtraction** ➖: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication** ✖️: Multiplies the two numbers.
- **Division** ➗: Divides the first number by the second (watch out for division by zero! 😅).

## How to Use 🚀

1. **Run the script** in a Python environment.
2. **Enter the first number** when prompted.
3. **Enter the second number** when prompted.
4. **View the results** of all four operations displayed on the screen.

### Example Usage 📝

```bash
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.0
Difference: 8.0
Product: 20.0
Quotient: 5.0
```

## Requirements 📋

- Python 3.x

## Notes ⚠️

- The calculator uses `float()` to handle decimal numbers.
- **Division by zero** will cause an error. The user is responsible for not dividing by zero (for now!). 😜

## Future Improvements 🔮

- Add error handling for division by zero.
- Include more operations like exponentiation or modulo.
- Make it a loop so users can perform multiple calculations without restarting.
